day-3
control flow
generic data
adding two different variables and seeing the reult
arrays
difference between 
write line(it overwrites on same line it is not extending to new line, it executes all the items, writing all the items problem here is it is rewriting on the line for multiple items) 
and append line(this will help you to write data in new line, if multiple data is available it helps to write next line onwards)
learn control flow statements

day-4

in arrays and datatables the index value start with zero, rest all one
write line activity means it shows result in output panel

day5:
control flow statement switch:it helps to switch the results,it is similar to if condition but in switch ine one condition we can execute three or more activities

switch:
based on the expression case will execute same as if condition, if condition will work based on true or false but in switch it will work based on expression, it can execute any one of the action

when to use this switch activity?
if you have some logic and needs to be executed 3 or 4 actions then we can use switch acticity



excel and workbook:
datatable variable: its a variable it stores bit piece of information from excels, this particular variable helps to save information in the form of rows and columns and also it acts as a database or the simple spread sheets
in datatable each individual cell will be identified as zero based index row based index or column name and index will start from zero

in read range excel we cannot give path it is directly asking range and we have an error too, we have to use use excel file as shown in error while hovering mouse. we have to use read range inside the use excel file.

as we are giving path in use excel file,
the benifit of using excel related activities are in the range by clicking + button we can directly indicate in excel and also it shows the sheet1 sheet2 they are automatically captured, as we have given path in use excel file. that means the changes are reflecting from parent level to child level.
for writing the data into excel we have to use writ data table to excel



msg box,write line, logmsg will only support string format
o/p data table will help in converting datatable to string

add data row will help you to add data inside rows which was created in build data table
