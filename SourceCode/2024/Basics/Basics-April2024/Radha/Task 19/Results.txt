            Overviewlink
            
            
            UI automation activities enable you to interact with graphical user interface elements in
               software applications. These activities include clicking buttons, typing into text
               boxes, selecting from dropdown menus, and more. This is done by using UiPath Robots
               that perform tasks the same way a human user would, making it easier to automate
               complex business processes and repetitive tasks.
            
            
            
            When automating user inferfaces, the initial phase consists in understanding the
               logical sequence of steps that a human user would take. Then the next phase consists
               in translating these steps into activities and configuring them. UI automation
               activities can serve as containers, input, output, and synchronization activities,
               while the activity properties determine how the UiPath Robots perform an action.
            
            
            
            The UI Automation activities include the following packages:

            About the Computer Vision Local Server packagelink
            
            
            The Computer Vision Local Server package contains no activities, but once installed in
               a project, enables you to use a local AI Computer Vision server.
            
            
            
            AI Computer Vision is an AI skill that allows all UiPath Robots to capture the screen
               and visually identify all the UI elements, rather than relying on selectors or
               images. It is an algorithm that enables human-like recognition of user interfaces,
               using a mix of AI, OCR, text fuzzy-matching, and an anchoring system to tie it all
               together.

            About the Mobile Automation activity packagelink
            
            
            The Mobile Automation activity package offers a robust set of activities for
               automating mobile application testing and interaction. It provides tools for testing
               Android and iOS applications, allowing actions like tapping, swiping, entering text,
               and validating mobile elements, among others. Key features of the activity package
               include:

            About the Terminal activity packagelink
            
            
            The Terminal activity package enables you to connect to a wide range of terminal
               environments using a direct connection or terminal emulators.
            
            
            
            You can then use activities to perform actions such as retrieving text, colors,
               fields, or screen positions, sending keys, moving the cursor, or waiting for certain
               text or fields to appear as triggers.
