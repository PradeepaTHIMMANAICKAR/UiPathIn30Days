Enhanced productivity – If you’re
                        familiar with coding or scripting you can leverage your skills and increase your
                        productivity. Working within a familiar coding environment allows you to develop more
                        efficient automations.
                     
                     
                     
                     Complexity management – Coded
                        automations provide a flexible solution for managing complex automation scenarios. By
                        using code, you can implement custom logic, manage exceptions, and create reusable
                        functions. As part of developing custom logic, you can easily create custom coded activity
                        packages, also known as services. Visit Registering custom services to learn how to create your first
                        service and start using it in your coded automations.
                     
                     
                     
                     Hybrid automation – You can use
                        coded automations alongside low-code automations. This promotes seamless integration
                        between the two approaches, enabling you to create flexible automation solutions.
                     
                     
                     
                     Improved performance – Coded
                        automations empower you to optimize your automation workflows to enhance performance. By
                        using code, you can implement specific algorithms to make your automation executions
                        faster.
                     
                     
                     
                     Readability – Coded automations
                        allow you to create structured code, resulting in code readability. If you organize your
                        code and document it, you can easily maintain it and share it with other collaborators.
