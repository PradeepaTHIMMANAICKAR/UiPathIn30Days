4 Mindfire Solutions Case Study
Future Relationship:
This has been one of our long running projects and each year the client was satisfied with the work done
at Mindfire Solutions. They have also referred the services of Mindfire Solutions to their peers and that
has been a rewarding experience. Not only have we added more clients but we also get to work on
various platforms to meet the needs of the client and their customers.
We are also the primary software services provider to the client who is planning to white label the
product as sell it to other organizations across industries.
